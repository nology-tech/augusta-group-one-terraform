## TODO

This is a Terraform template
<!-- TODO ----> Type 'control + f' for windows or 'command + f' for Mac then type "TODO" so you can then edit the template and add the correct AMI configuration -->
<!-- TODO ----> Will need to change the inventory.txt file ip address (THIS IP IS A SSH instance IP) -->
<!-- TODO ----> Then once configured run terrafrom init - terraform plan - terraform apply --> This will create your VPC in AWS
<!-- -The AWS Key is universal so everybody in the group has the same key placed in their .ssh file. -->

## What is Terraform

- Terraform is an open-source tool for building, changing, and versioning infrastructure safely and efficiently. It can manage popular service providers as well as custom in-house solutions. Terraform describes infrastructure as code and can track and manage changes, allowing infrastructure to be treated as a versionable asset.

How does Terraform apply to the project?

- Terraform has been selected as the orchestration tool for infrastructure and deployment to AWS, and will handle deployment through Jenkins following a successful build job using Packer. The newest AMI generated by Packer will be utilized by Terraform.
